<p>Hi there, I'm Conor and this is my website. I'm a software engineer from dublin and this is where I document all of the fun stuff that I do in my spare time. Stick around have a read, maybe you'll get a laugh</p>

<p>You can expect a fair amount of ruby, and ruby on rails. Those are my bread and butter. But I'm a huge fan of IOT so I'm also down to clown with python. Java too for my work</p>

<p class="mb-5">And I guess that's it, this site was created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, and deployed on <a
        href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/conorbr/breen_blog">here</a></p>
