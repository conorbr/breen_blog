Hello, if you're reading this there is a good chance you're at the showcase. This is my project OpenSesamessage!

It couldn't be easier to setup, just add the device to your contacts

<code>phone number: 0899433965</code>

and message it on telegram with the password. if you don't have telegram you can download it here:

<code>android users click <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Telegram+Messenger+LLP&hl=en">here</a></code>

<code>apple users click <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?mt=8">here</a></code>

and voila your ready to go. message it with the password <code>Password</code> (capital "P") and your ready to give it commands.

try a few of these:
<ul>
<li>hello</li>
<li>open</li>
<li>photo</li>
<li>status</li>
</ul>
