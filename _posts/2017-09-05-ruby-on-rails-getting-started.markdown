# Started from the bottom..

I've decided to have my next tutorial be based on Ruby on Rails. I've also decided that I would rather drink a pint of bleach than waste my server space and the world's time than contribute another "how to make a blog" tutorial to the internet.

So I've decided to play to my interests with web scraping and make an image aggregation site to scrape images from the internet and put them in one place for easy consumption.

The plan is to break down each aspect of this project into a blog post, each time touching on something new. so to begin we'll have creating the rails application, gems etc, then move from backend to front end and finally resulting in the next big-hit-sensation website, rivalling the greats.
